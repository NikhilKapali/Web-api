# Frontend code architecture

For the frontend portion I have used HTML, CSS, jQuery, Ajax, bootstrap and javascript. HTML has been used to create the basic frontend structure for the system and CSS has been used to make the system more attractive where as bootstrap has been used to create a more responsive system. jQuery, Ajax abd javascripts have been used to communicate with the backed and is used to retrive and store various types of data.

The Frontend code portion of the project includes basic User Interface consisting of various use of design methods like HTML,
Bootstrap, JavaScript etc. To create a clear and understandable environment all the required files are kept in separate folders. CSS, JS, Admin, User and image folders can be seen where they only have the respective file for them. Inside the User folder, the required html files are stored as well as a js folder can be seen where all the required js files for the user are stored. Similarly for the Admin folder, the required html files are stored as well as a js folder can be seen where all the required js files for the Admin are stored. Some of the required files are out in the open for example login, dashboard and register and their respective js files are in the open as well.
